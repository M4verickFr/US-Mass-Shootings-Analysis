The objective of this project is to visualize and analyze the different mass-shooting in the USA.

<p> With the different graphs, we can make a comparison according to the states, and the period and see the different global statistics on the events. </p>

Initially, the approach comes from a school project in engineering training "Informatique Données d'Usages" at Polytech Annecy-Chambéry. Our goal was to make a one-page representation with the help of the d3JS library.
